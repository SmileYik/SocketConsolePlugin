   * passed in to this method allows the Filter to pass on the request and
   * response to the next entity in the chain.
   * <p>
   * A typical implementation of this method would follow the following
   * pattern:- <br>
   * 1. Examine the request<br>
   * 2. Optionally wrap the request object with a custom implementation to
   * filter content or headers for input filtering <br>
   * 3. Optionally wrap the response object with a custom implementation to
   * filter content or headers for output filtering <br>
   * 4. a) <strong>Either</strong> invoke the next entity in the chain using
   * the FilterChain object (<code>chain.doFilter()</code>), <br>
   * 4. b) <strong>or</strong> not pass on the request/response pair to the
   * next entity in the filter chain to block the request processing<br>
   * 5. Directly set headers on the response after invocation of the next
   * entity in the filter chain.
   *
   * @param request  The request to process
   * @param response The response associated with the request
   * @param chain    Provides access to the next filter in the chain for this
   *                 filter to pass the request and response to for further
   *                 processing
   * @throws IOException      if an I/O error occurs during this filter's
   *                          processing of the request
